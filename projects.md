## Description of Project
Project one asked students do complete the following tasks: 
1) Create a new repo for all of our upcoming projects, clone the repo to our computer, create a folder called project 1, add all the commands used to do the previous steps into the folder
2) We collaboratd with teammates, for me I worked with two other students, where I created a new repo for our collaboration and added a document called "name of group members." Each student in the group, including myself, would clone the repo to their computer and then add basic information about themselves using code to the group member file. After this was completed, each student would have a document that they created that housed all the code they ran to update the group name file. We then pushed the changes to the group name file and our code to git hub and assigned a group member to review and pull all the changes into the main branch. 
3) Finally, we made a website using git hub. Following simmilar steps above, I created a new repo, cloned the repo to my computer, and created an index file that allowed me to add informaiton about myself to my website. We then added this simple document has a short description of the first project. We then pushed all the changes to git hub and performed our own pull requests.
